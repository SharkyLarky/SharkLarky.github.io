                        <article>
                            I really liked the Dungen Meshi manga so when I heard they were relasing an anime adaptation I was really excited. I really enjoy the anime as it captures the manga in such as good light, though there are a few things
                            the changed or removed but those are minor. Overall its my #1 favorite currently thought hey havent shown Izutsumi yet as of typing this so its not as good as it could be (lol). I can't wait to see how they animate the 
                            crews silly little seanagens even further.
